Term Definitions
- baseline: "standard" against which anomalies are calculated, AR6 mostly uses 1850-1900
- detection: processes of determine the climate system has changed in a statistical sense (no reason provided)
- attribution: processes of determining causal factors to observed change/events

Confidence Levels: Box 1.1 Figure 1
- statements of evidence and agreement (ex. _limited evidence, high agreement_)
- statements of confidence (ex. _high confidence_)
- statements of likelihood (ex. _virtually certain_)

Shared Socioeconomic Pathways
- _insert table with all those definitions 
- scenario name has two parts: the SSP storyline assignment, and the approximate radiative forcing in 2100
	- I don't understand the difference between the top of atmosphere cumulative vs "acted on" values?
	- SSP1-1.9 approximately relates to limiting to 1.5C (assuming 3C climate sensitivity)
	- SSP1-2.6 approximately relates to limiting to 2C (assuming 3C climate sensitivity)

Climate Models
- Global Circulation Model (GCM):
- Earth System Model (ESM):
- CMIP processing happens on the IPCC AR schedule it seems?
